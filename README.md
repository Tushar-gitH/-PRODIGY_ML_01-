House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project was completed as part of my Machine Learning internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
It focuses on building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

Key Highlights:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Model building using Scikit-learn

Evaluation using RÂ² score and MSE

Data visualization for better insights

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
